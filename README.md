#A raytracer written in Rust

This is my first project with rust. I'm kind of following [this](nam://bheisler.github.io/post/writing-raytracer-in-rust/) series of blog posts. Brook Heisler also published the whole source code on [his GitHub](https://github.com/bheisler/raytracer).

I also plan on creating a blog to this repository explaining each step of the way. For now the steps will be listed here as bullet points.

## Baby steps

  - Install Rust
    - Put some URL and shell command here. TODO
  - `cargo new raytracer_project_name --bin` (or `mkdir raytracer_project` + `cargo init --bin`)
  - Initial dependencies
    - [image](https://crates.io/crates/image)
      - TODO explain what how why
    - [serde](https://crates.io/crates/serde)
      - TODO explain what how why
    - [serde\_derive](https://crates.io/crates/serde_derive)
      - TODO explain what how why
    - The [crates.io](https://crates.io/)
      - TODO explain what it is, how it works and how to use it (use case scenarios)
  - Modules
    - TODO how we'll structure our codebase
  - Raytracer basics
    - Vector mod
    - Point mod
    - Colors, Spheres and Scenes
    - Renderer
